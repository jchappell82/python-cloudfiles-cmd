Interactive Command line Interface to Rackspace Cloud Files
----------------------------------

Description:
------------
This is a python based command line interface for Rackspace Cloud Files.  It provides a nice interactive interface to manage your Cloud Files from the Linux or Window machines using python.

I know we can always use python API commands and curl to list things, but it might be helpful for customers who have no programming knowledge, and also they call the upload or download files directly from cron job, etc.


Current implemented function:
-----------------------------
list containers
create container
delete container(empty containers)
container info - gives information about a container, like total size, publish status, CDN URL.
list files
delete files
upload files
download files

USAGE
-----
root@ssidhu-dv6:/home/ssidhu/Dropbox/tinkering/scripts/python_cf# python cf.py 
Login with credentials from ~/.pycflogin file? [yes/no]yes

I have created it in a module way, so each of those functions can be called individually without actually running interpreter, so if somebody wants to just grab a list of files in a container, he can just call the individual function files.  This will help if somebody wants to write their own scripts.

root@ssidhu-dv6:/home/ssidhu/Dropbox/tinkering/scripts/python_cf# python cf_list_containers.py

Some ideas about next features to add:
-------------------------------------
delete container along with it's all files(non empty containers)
publish/unpublish containers
file info - will provide all the info about a file, size, CDN URL, meta data, etc
purge from CDN
upload multiple directories, handling of pseudo directories.
use of servicenet option
